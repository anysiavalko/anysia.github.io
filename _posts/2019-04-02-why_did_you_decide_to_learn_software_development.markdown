I wasn't interested in coding, nor did I know anything about it, until I had to teach it.  Three years ago, I was a language teacher--not any kind of programming language, but actual spoken language--Spanish and French, to be exact.  I did and still do love foreign languages, but constantly seeking new ways to convince teenagers that conjugating verbs and memorizing vocabulary was exciting and useful took away much the joy of learning and speaking languages that I had always felt.  I just couldn't relate to the resistance I was met with--I had always looked forward to my language classes (I studied several in high school and college), and the majority of my students were reluctantly taking Spanish or French as a graduation requirement, and thus had no interest in anything other than what grade they were leaving with.  I also had to follow a strict curriculum, and rush them along all year so that they could pass the county final exams.  In addition, I was spending long hours at night creating worksheets, presentations and tests and grading papers, and I couldn't reconcile how much work I was putting into something that wasn't all that gratifying to me.  When I separated from my ex-husband and became a single mother, I knew I had to make a big change to maintain my sanity and my happiness.  

I thought about a computer applications class I had once taught, a random, stray course that a school gave me one year -- it was a middle school elective rotation introducing kids to programs like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint-- but it was a ton of fun to teach, because most of the kids were already interested in computer activities, and I could design my own curriculum--there was no scary exam at the end that consumed our minds with test-anxiety.  I also didn't have to spend hours every night grading essays- a huge plus for a single parent.  *Okay, this is it!*, I thought.  *I'm going to become a computer teacher.*  I applied for every job I could find, citing my very minimal experience, but also my enthusiasm, flexibility and work ethic.  I landed an interview with a great school, for a position as a computer applications teacher.  I figured the job would consist of teaching the same basic programs I had taught before, and nothing told me otherwise.  However, once I was hired, I found out that the job consisted of teaching digital photography, desktop publishing, and web design.  I knew what all of those words meant individually, but I did not know what they meant when they were combined into phrases, let alone how to teach those subjects!  I also had to be the yearbook teacher!  I panicked, and went back and forth in my mind about if this was now the right position for me, or if I should go back to Spanish or French.  

Finally, I decided that I was going to do it.  I could learn some over the summer, and I could learn the rest as I went throughout the year.  But it would be worth it.  And somehow I did it-- I taught myself how to teach publishing, and photography, how to create a yearbook and work with tons of people to get it printed and into the hands of 1,300 students.  And I learned how to teach basic concepts of web design.  That was the class I was most scared of.  What was web design-- making complicated websites full of pictures and payment options??  Typing all kinds of neon green numbers and computery-text into a black screen and magically creating a webpage?  I was not a web design person!  But I had to do it, and I did it.  I learned basic principles of creating effective websites, and I had my students practice designing them- the visual part, and then making their own drag and drop sites.  I learned Scratch, which introduces kids to programming by having them combine different kinds of command blocks to create their own custom games, and I learned some Python, and taught them how to make very simple text-based games, like "Guess the number" and Choose Your Own Adventure."  It was amazing, to step back after two years of teaching web design, and yearbook, and everything else and think, *Oh my gosh, I did it*.  My students loved my classes.  I loved my classes.  They were having fun and learning very practical skills, and I was having fun getting to be creative and having control over my own curriculums.  And while I still wasn't getting a ton of sleep, because I was always reworking my lessons, I didn't have hours of papers to go through every night, which was a giant improvement in mental health.  

I was very happy as a computer teacher.  Now, teaching is an exceptionally stressful job-- you're always "on," always running a show, you don't get breaks (even at lunch), and you deal with all sorts of different drama every day.  You must keep 30+ teenagers (mostly boys in my case--one time 28 boys and only 2 girls! ) focused and on-task while you attempt to teach them something new.  But for a teacher, I felt pretty darn lucky to be doing what I was doing.  And I was getting kind of good at using Python.  Eventually, I started to think, *Hey I could really learn this, and maybe... be a programmer?  Maybe?*  I mentioned it to my boyfriend/future husband, and he agreed that it might be something I could be talented at.  So later on, when I got remarried, and he and I started discussing the possibility of me taking a year off work to focus on some other priorities, the subject of trying out programming naturally came up.  He was very encouraging and supporitve of my choice to join a coding school, and helped me find what we considered to be the best one, Flatiron.  

Since then my confidence has been up and down, depending on how difficult I am finding the lessons to be, or how long the labs take me, or how much time I have to devote to learning during the day, but throughout my time in the school, I have always maintained my desire to continue programming and to see how far I can go with it.
